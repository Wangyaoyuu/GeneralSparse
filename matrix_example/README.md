### Suite Matrix Collection

#### Examples

- IG5-18.mtx 

#### More Matrix

1. The matrix can be downloaded in [SuiteSparse](https://sparse.tamu.edu/).

2. The original mtx is in COO column-major order, and the adjusted matrix input is in COO row-major order format.


### Pruned Weight Matrix 

#### Examples

- Using Magnitude pruning method and 90% sparsity.

- Using Random pruning method and 90% sparsity.

- Limited by the file size limit on GitHub, we further reduced the number of non-zero elements in the weight matrix.

#### More Pruned Weight Matrix of Models

1. The pruned weight matrix is generated by [FlashLLM](https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/flash-llm/tree/main/end2end_inference/ft_tools).

2. The document of this pruning process is in [FlashLLM-prepare](https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/flash-llm/blob/main/docs/3_LLMInferenceExample.md).
